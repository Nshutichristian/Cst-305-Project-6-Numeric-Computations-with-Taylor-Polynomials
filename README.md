# CST-305 Project 6: Numerical Computations with Taylor Series and Polynomials

## Overview
This project is designed to numerically solve differential equations using Taylor polynomial approximations and standard numerical solvers. It contains three major parts:

- **Part 1 (a & b):** Solves second-order differential equations using Taylor series approximations.
- **Part 2:** Uses `solve_ivp` to solve an initial value problem involving a nonlinear ODE.
- **Part 3:** Models and solves a computer system performance equation using `odeint`.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Files Included
- `TaylorPolynomial Part1_2_3.py`: Full Python script combining Parts 1, 2, and 3
- `Graphs part 1 2 and 3.dox`: Docx file that includes graphs showing Parts 1, 2 and  computer performance over time (generated in Part 3)
- `README.md`: This file
- `Documention project 6.docx`: Documentation with problem explanation and implementation overview

## How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
python CST305_Project6_Final_Combined.py
```

## Output
Each part will display a plot in a new window:
- Taylor approximation plots (Part 1a and 1b)
- Numerical solution of the ODE (Part 2)
- System performance decay (Part 3)
